# Battle-Tanks
A simple 2d battle tank game.

Players alternate firing at one another across the screen.  A barrier in the middle prevents them from moving into each other.
There are three difficulty levels.  See if you can beat them all!

To install:
Download build.zip from the repo.  Extract and copy wherever you like.  Run Tanks.exe to play!
